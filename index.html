                    <p>Hello! My name is Faria Shahriar and I am from Clinton, Massachusetts! I am currently a senior at Boston University studying computer science with a minor in biology. In my introductory and upper level course work at BU, I've developed a strong passion for the field of bioinformatics. Through various experiences, I have been able to apply my knowledge to the world around me and am now extremely interested in pursuing opportunities related to these fields. My ultimate goal is to study bioinformatics / computational biology in graduate school.  </p>
                    <p>Thank you for visiting my website! Here you will find my work experiences, projects, skills, and other information that might be of interest to you. Feel free to reach out to me at farias@bu.edu!</p>
